        We are going to Murcia, Spain to serve the church planted there. We will help the church leaders, youth, and children in
        whatever they need. If you have it on your heart to donate, it will be very much appreciated. May God bless you and

        Hello, this is Emma and Emily and we are currently a part of BBS 2023. We are so excited to have the opportunity to
        serve in Tanzania this year. We would appreciate any financial support you are able to offer as we prepare supplies,
        activities, and other items to better serve the kids at the center. If you aren't able to help financially please pray
        for us and the children we will be serving! Thank you and God bless!
